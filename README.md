# ! No Duplicate Followers

This module allows administrators to control whether followers are duplicated along with the project and task records in PwO.

## Configuration

After installing this module, go to Settings and look for "No Duplicate Followers Settings" under the General Settings tab. There, you can activate or deactivate follower notifications upon duplication.

## Usage

When the setting is activated, duplicating a project will not duplicate its followers, preventing automatic email notifications to the duplicated project's followers.
